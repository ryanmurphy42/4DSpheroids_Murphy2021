Data files used to compute maximum likelihoods and profile likelihoods.

Data for tumour spheroids with cell lines (and number of cells used to form spheroids)
WM793b (1250, 2500, 5000, 10000 total cells/well initially)
WM983b (1250, 2500, 5000, 10000 total cells/well initially)
WM164 (1250, 2500, 5000, 10000 total cells/well initially)

Synthetic data generated as per Supplementary Material E includes:
Syntheticdata1 (10 of each measurement type per timepoint)
syntheticdata2 (48 of each measurement type per timepoint)
syntheticdata4 (data for each initial condition)

NOTE: Outer radius data, inhibited radius data, and necrotic radius data are stored in separate files (x_IncuCyte_confocal_outer, x_confocal_inhibited, x_confocal_necrotic, respectively).
